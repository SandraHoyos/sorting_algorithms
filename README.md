## Sorting algorithms
In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.
- The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).
- The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.
## Big O
Big O notation makes you grasp the very important concept of efficiency in your code. So when you do work with huge data sets, you will have a good sense of where major slowdowns are likely to cause bottlenecks, and where more attention should be paid to get the largest improvements. This is also called sensitivity analysis, and is an important part of solving problems and writing great software.s.
